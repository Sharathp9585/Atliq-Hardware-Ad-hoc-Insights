### Problem Statement
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts.

- Check [ad-hoc-requests.pdf](ad-hoc-requests.pdf) - there are 6 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights. I was required to run a SQL query to answer those requests. The target audience was top-level management.

### Action
- Use MySQL database for storing the records
